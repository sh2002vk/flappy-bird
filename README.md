# flappy-bird

I made this basic flappy bird app to implement a genetic algorithm which teaches the program to keep getting better at playing the game itself.
The idea is that there will be multiple "birds" running at the same time and the only the ones that survive longest will be replicated. It is 
similar to natural selection in nature. 

It is still under development. I hope to use this project as a stepping stool to get into AI.
